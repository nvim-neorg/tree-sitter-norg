* Norg File Format Specification
  This file contains the formal file format specification of the _Norg_ syntax version 0.1.
  This document is written in the Norg format in its original form and, thus, attempts to be
  self-documenting.

** Introduction
   Before diving into the details we will start with a short introduction.
   The _Norg_ file format was designed as part of the [Neorg] plugin for Neovim which was started by
   /Vhyrro (@vhyrro)/ in April of 2021.
   Soon after starting this work, /Max Rossmannek (@mrossinek)/ joined the development team, and,
   with the help of the [Neorg] community, the two have shaped the _Norg_ syntax to what it has
   become today.

   [Neorg]{https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg}

*** What is Norg?
    The _Norg_ syntax is a plain-text file format which aims to be human readable when viewed
    standalone while also providing a suite of markup utilities for typesetting structured
    documents. Compared to other plain-text file formats like e.g. Markdown, RST or AsciiDoc, it
    sets itself apart most notably by following a strict philosophy to abide by the following simple
    rules:
    ~ *Consistency:* the syntax should be consistent. Even if you know only a part of the syntax,
      learning new parts should not be surprising and rather feel predictable and intuitive.
    ~ *Unambiguity:* the syntax should leave _no_ room for ambiguity. This is especially motivated
      by the use of [tree-sitter] for the original syntax parser which takes a strict left-to-right
      parsing approach and only has single-character look-ahead.
    ~ *[free-form]:* whitespace is _only_ used to delimit tokens but has no other significance! This
      is probably the most contrasting feature to other plain-text formats which often adhere to the
      [off-side rule], meaning that the syntax relies on whitespace-indentation to carry meaning.

    [tree-sitter]{https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/}
    [off-side rule]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule}
    [Free-form]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-form_language}

** Preliminaries
   First, we define some basic concepts which will be used in this specification.


*** Characters
    A _Norg_ file is made up of /characters/.
    A <character> is any Unicode [code point].

    [code point]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point}

**** Whitespace
     A {> character} is considered to be *whitespace* if it is any of the following:
     - a tab `U+0009`
     - a line feed `U+000A`
     - a form feed `U+000C`
     - a carriage return `U+000D`
     - any code point in the [Unicode Zs general category] (includes the normal space `U+0020`)

     Any combination of the above is also considered whitespace.

     Tabs are not expanded to spaces and since whitespace has no semantic meaning there is no need
     to define a default tab stop. However, if a parser must (for implementation reasons) define a
     tab stop, we suggest to set it to 4 spaces.

     However, the following whitespace combinations are a <line ending>:
     - a single line feed
     - a single carriage return
     - a carriage return immediately followed by a line feed

     ^ Blank lines are irrelevant in _Norg_ because standalone whitespace has no semantic relevance.

     [Unicode Zs general category]{https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/Zs/list.htm}

**** Punctuation
     A {> character} is considered to be *punctuation* if it is any of the following:
     - a standard ASCII punctuation character: |`!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~`|

       +TODO: check whether we want to support every punctuation mark from the `en_US.utf8` locale+

**** Escaping
     A single {> character} can be escaped if it is immediately preceded by a backslash, `\`
     (`U+005C`). Any {> character} may be escaped /apart from/ {> character}s within verbatim
     segments +TODO: add link to verbatim segments+.

**** Special Character
     - | | TODO: formalize this section
     - Emojis
     +- Should we support [entity references]?
     [entity references]{https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#entity-references}
     vhyrro: I'm personally very against this idea tbh. I don't see an immediate use case for it,
     perhaps if it's a lifesaver for some we could modify the syntax a little by enforcing
     &nbsp& instead of &nbsp;+

*** Words
    The _Norg_ format is designed to be parsed on a word-by-word basis from left-to-right through
    the entire document /in a single pass/. This is possible because the language is [Free-form],
    meaning that whitespace has no semantic meaning, and because the markup follows strict rules
    which are outlined in the later sections of this document.

    A *word* is considered to be any combination of {> character}s which are neither {# whitespace},
    {# punctuation} nor other {# special character}s.

*** Paragraph Segments
    {# Words} are first combined into {# paragraph segments}. A segment gets terminated by any of
    the following:
    - a {> line ending}
    - any of the {# attached modifiers} +NOTE(vhyrro): Don't paragraph segments contain attached mods?+
    - any of the {# linkables} +Same here+

*** Paragraphs
    Paragraphs are then formed of consecutive {# paragraph segments}, {# attached modifiers} or
    {# linkables}. A paragraph is terminated by:
    - a _paragraph break_ (which equals two consecutive {> line endings})
    - any of the {# detached modifiers}
    - any of the {# delimiting modifiers}

** Detached Modifiers
   _Norg_ has several detached modifiers. The name originates from their differentiation to the
   {# Attached Modifiers}, which will be discussed later.

   All detached modifiers must abide by the following rules:
   - a detached modifier can _only_ occur at the beginning of the line (arbitrary {# whitespace}
     (but nothing else!) may precede it)
   - a detached modifier must be immediately followed by {# whitespace} (incl. a {> line ending}),
     another detached modifier of the same type or by a {# detached modifier extensions}[detached
     modifier extension]

   The following list outlines all valid *detached* modifiers. The list also adds three possible
   properties to each category which will be explained in more detail below.
   - `*`: {# Headings} (structural, nestable)
   - `%`: {# Markers} (structural)
   - `-`: {# Unordered Lists} (nestable)
   - `~`: {# Ordered Lists} (nestable)
   - `>`: {# Quotes} (nestable)
   - `$`: {# Definitions} (range-able)
   - `^`: {# Footnotes} (range-able)
   - `=`: {# Insertions} (range-able)

*** Standard Detached Modifiers
    The normal rules for the /standard/ detached modifiers are simple as outlined above. An
    important differentiation is, that standard detached modifiers may _not_ be succeeded by another
    detached modifier and instead require a whitespace immediately after them.
    They then affect the interpretation of the following `paragraph_segment` which generally means
    they extend up to the end of the current line.

*** Nestable Detached Modifiers
    Nestable detached modifiers are those kind which may be repeated multiple times in order to
    produce a _nested_ object of the given type. The nesting levels are capped at 6 in the
    [tree-sitter] parser but longer repetitions of the same modifier are allowed, falling back to
    the sixth nesting level. Other parses may choose to support higher nesting levels.

    Furthermore, in contrast to the {# Standard Detached Modifiers} this detached modifier type
    affects the following `paragraph` instead of only the next segment. This means that in order to
    terminate the detached modifier contents, you need two consecutive line breaks (forming a
    `paragraph_break`).

    Here are some correct examples of the nestable detached modifiers:

**** Unordered Lists
     @code norg
     - Unordered list level 1
     -- Unordered list level 2
     --- Unordered list level 3
     ---- Unordered list level 4
     ----- Unordered list level 5
     ------ Unordered list level 6
     ------- Unordered list level 7 (falls back to level 6 in the tree-sitter parser)

     - Unordered list level 1
       This text is still part of the level 1 list item.
     -- Unordered list level 2
        This text is still part of the level 2 list item.
     --- Unordered list level 3
         This text is still part of the level 3 list item.
     ---- Unordered list level 4
          This text is still part of the level 4 list item.
     ----- Unordered list level 5
           This text is still part of the level 5 list item.
     ------ Unordered list level 6
            This text is still part of the level 6 list item.
     ------- Unordered list level 7 (falls back to level 6 in the tree-sitter parser)
             This text is still part of the level 7 list item.
     @end

**** Ordered Lists
     @code norg
     ~ Ordered list level 1
     ~~ Ordered list level 2
     ~~~ Ordered list level 3
     ~~~~ Ordered list level 4
     ~~~~~ Ordered list level 5
     ~~~~~~ Ordered list level 6
     ~~~~~~~ Ordered list level 7 (falls back to level 6 in the tree-sitter parser)

     ~ Ordered list level 1
       This text is still part of the level 1 list item.
     ~~ Ordered list level 2
        This text is still part of the level 2 list item.
     ~~~ Ordered list level 3
         This text is still part of the level 3 list item.
     ~~~~ Ordered list level 4
          This text is still part of the level 4 list item.
     ~~~~~ Ordered list level 5
           This text is still part of the level 5 list item.
     ~~~~~~ Ordered list level 6
            This text is still part of the level 6 list item.
     ~~~~~~~ Ordered list level 7 (falls back to level 6 in the tree-sitter parser)
             This text is still part of the level 7 list item.
     @end

**** Quotes
     @code norg
     > Quote level 1
     >> Quote level 2
     >>> Quote level 3
     >>>> Quote level 4
     >>>>> Quote level 5
     >>>>>> Quote level 6
     >>>>>>> Quote level 7 (falls back to level 6 in the tree-sitter parser)

     > Quote level 1
       This text is still part of the level 1 quote.
     >> Quote level 2
        This text is still part of the level 2 quote.
     >>> Quote level 3
         This text is still part of the level 3 quote.
     >>>> Quote level 4
          This text is still part of the level 4 quote.
     >>>>> Quote level 5
           This text is still part of the level 5 quote.
     >>>>>> Quote level 6
            This text is still part of the level 6 quote.
     >>>>>>> Quote level 7 (falls back to level 6 in the tree-sitter parser)
             This text is still part of the level 7 quote.
     @end
     ---

    Here are some invalid examples of detached modifiers:

    @code norg
    >I am not a quote

    some preceding text $ I am not a definition

    >$ I am not a detached modifier

    > > I am only a level 1 quote
    @end

    Headings are also /nestable/ detached modifiers but will only be discussed later as part of the
    {# structural detached modifiers}.

*** Structural Detached Modifiers
    The `*` (headings) and `%` (marker) detached modifiers also have the _structural_ property,
    meaning that these objects *structure* the _Norg_ document.
    This detached modifier type only affects the following `paragraph_segment` (just like the
    {# standard detached modifiers}).

**** Headings
    @code norg
    * Heading level 1
    ** Heading level 2
    *** Heading level 3
    **** Heading level 4
    ***** Heading level 5
    ****** Heading level 6
    ******* Heading level 7 (falls back to level 6 in the tree-sitter parser)
    @end

    Although headings are both, structural and nestable, the former takes precedence over the
    latter, meaning that headings only affect a `paragraph_segment`. This is for user convenience as
    it does not require an empty line right below a heading.

**** Markers
     @code norg
     % Marker
     @end
     Markers are purely structural elements which split the entire document right down to the root
     node.

**** Delimiting Modifiers
     Although not technically a detached modifier, we would like to insert a note on
     {# Delimiting Modifiers} because they are immediately related to structuring a _Norg_ document.
     This kind of modifier must abide by the following rules:
     - a delimiting modifier can _only_ occur at the beginning of the line (an arbitrary
       {# whitespace} (but nothing else!) may precede it)
     - a delimiting modifier must consist of three or more consecutive modifiers of the same type
     - it must be followed by an immediate {> line ending} (without any extra {# whitespace})

***** Weak Delimiting Modifier
      This modifier uses the `-` character and immediately closes the current heading level.
      @code norg
      * Heading level 1
        Text under first level heading.

      ** Heading level 2
         Text under second level heading.
         ---

        Text under first level heading again.
      @end

***** Strong Delimiting Modifier
      This modifier uses the `=` character and immediately closes all heading levels.
      @code norg
      * Heading level 1
        Text under first level heading.

      ** Heading level 2
         Text under second level heading.
         ===

      Text belonging to no heading level (i.e. to the document's root node).
      @end

***** Horizontal Rule
      This modifier uses the `_` character and simply renders a horizontal line. It does _NOT_
      affect the heading level but immediately ends a {# paragraph}.
      @code norg
      * Heading level 1
        Text under first level heading.
        ___
        This is a new paragraph separated from the previous one by a horizontal line.
        This text still belongs to the first level heading.
      @end

*** Range-able Detached Modifiers
    Range-able detached modifiers can occur in two forms:
    - as a single detached modifier they affect:
    -- the next `paragraph_segment` which becomes the /title/
    -- the `paragraph` following that which becomes the /content/
    - or they can occur as a pair of two detached modifiers in which case:
    -- the next `paragraph_segment` still becomes the /title/
    -- but the content continues until the "closing" detached modifier is found

**** Definitions
     @code norg
     $ Single Definition
     Optional definition content.
     @end

     @code norg
     $$ Multiple Definition
     Content of the definition.

     Which scans up to the closing modifier.
     $$
     @end

**** Footnotes
     @code norg
     ^ Single Footnote
     Optional footnote content.
     @end

     @code norg
     ^^ Multiple Footnote
     Content of the footnote.

     Which scans up to the closing modifier.
     ^^
     @end

**** Insertions
     @code norg
     = Insertion arg1 arg2 ...
     @end
     Depending on the kind of insertion, a different number of arguments can be set/required. These
     arguments follow the same rules as those of {# Tags}.

     @code norg
     == Function definition
     ==
     @end

*** Detached Modifier Extensions
    {# Detached modifiers} support extensions which must immediately follow the detached modifier
    (or another extension).

**** ToDo Status Extension
     The ToDo item extension assigns a task status to a certain modifier. You probably know this
     concept from Markdown where unordered lists can become tasks. In _Norg_ we take this concept to
     the next level because any detached modifier can be assigned a task status. This can for
     example be useful for the author of a document to keep track of the status of certain sections.
     The syntax is the following:
     - a todo status extension starts with a `|` char
     - immediately a single status indicator character must follow. The following statuses are
       supported:
    -- ` `: undone (a literal space)
    -- `x`: done
    -- `?`: needs further input/clarification
    -- `!`: urgent
    -- `+`: recurring
    -- `-`: in-progress/pending
    -- `=`: on hold
    -- `_`: put down/cancelled
    - finally another `|` char closes the todo status extension

**** Indent Segment Extension
     Since {# nestable detached modifiers} can only contain a {# paragraphs}[paragraph] this can
     cause severe limitations because insertion of (for example) code blocks is not possible. To
     alleviate this deficiency, the {# indent segment extension} exists, which increases the
     indentation of the tree by one level allowing nesting of more complex elements to occur.
     The syntax is the following:
     - the indent segment extension starts with a single `\` char
     - this must be _immediately_ followed by a {# line ending}
     -- thus, the start node of this extension can be seen as a {# trailing modifier}
     - the contents follow
     - the extension ends when:
     -- another {# nestable detached modifier} occurs
     -- or when the indentation is manually closed with one of the {# delimiting modifiers}

     @code norg
     - \
       The indent segment extension has started.

       I can now include multple paragraphs into this list item.

       @code lua
       print("Even code blocks are allowed!")
       @end

       ^ Range-able detached modifiers can be inserted, too.

       ---
     - another nestable detached modifier ends the indent segment
     - However, in this example I already closed the indent segment manually with `---`
     @end

** Tags

*** Carryover Tags
    @code norg
    |carryover param1 param2 "multi word param" "another param"
    @end

*** Ranged Tags

**** Ranged Tags which support nested _Norg_ syntax
     @code norg
     #table
     *heading* | /heading/ | _heading_
     first | second | third
     1 | | 3
     | 2 |
     #end
     @end

**** Ranged Tags which do *NOT* support nested _Norg_ syntax
     @code java
     @MyAnnotation(name="someName",  value="Hello World")
     public class TheClass {
       // ...
     }
     @end

** Attached Modifiers
   We can finally discuss attached modifiers (which originally gave rise to the name of
   {# detached modifiers} as their natural counter-parts). Here are the general rules for attached
   modifiers:
   - an opening modifier may only be preceded by whitespace or punctuation
   - an opening modifier may _NOT_ be succeeded by whitespace
   - a closing modifier may _NOT_ be preceded by whitespace
   - a closing modifier may only be succeeded by whitespace or punctuation

   The following attached modifiers exist and have the respective meaning:
   - \*bold\*: *bold*
   - \/italic\/: /italic/
   - \_underline\_: _underline_
   - \-strikethrough\-: -strikethrough-
   - \!spoiler\!: !spoiler!
   - \^superscript\^: ^superscript^  (when nested into `subscript`, will highlight as an error)
   - \,subscript\,: ,subscript,  (when nested into `superscript`, will highlight as an error)
   - \`inline code\`: `inline code`  (disables any nested markup)
   - \+inline comment\+: +inline comment+  (disables any nested markup)
   - \$inline math\$: $f(x) = y$  (disables any nested markup)
   - \=variable\=: =variable=  (disables any nested markup)

*** Link Modifier
    The link modifier, `:`, is a special modifier type called an _intersecting_ modifier. It puts a
    twist on the original attached modifier rules because it allows non-whitespace characters in
    front of the opening or after the closing modifier. This allows the intersection of a
    non-whitespace string like so:
    @code norg
    Ex:*am*:ple
    @end
    Without the `:`-link modifier, the above example would not result in a bold segment.

    - | | TODO: currently states in the docs that it must occur in pairs but this is not enforced by
          the TS parser. I.e. the following is valid: ex:_ample_

*** Ranged Attached Modifiers
    Ranged attached modifiers can be used to:
    - allow arbitrary whitespace within attached modifiers (including line breaks!)
    - allow to represent verbatim attached modifier chars within the corresponding verbatim blocks

    For example:
    @code norg
    Here, I am using some |*ranged bold
    modifiers*| which allows me to span
    the line break.
    @end

    @code norg
    Here, I can write |`  leading and trailing whitespace  `| within a verbatim block.
    @end

    @code norg
    Here, I can use a literal `$` inside of inline math: |$ 10$ + 10$ = 20$ $|.
    @end

** Trailing Modifier
   Trailing modifiers are another separate kind of modifiers in the _Norg_ syntax. They must follow
   these rules:
   - it may only exist at the end of a line and may not be followed by any characters after iteself
   - it may only not have whitespace in front of it
   -- | | do we want to enforce the above? If not, we can denote the `\` detached modifier extension
          as a trailing modifier

*** Line Continuation
    The `~`-trailing modifier will concatenate the line which it ends with the following one.
    This allows you to do something like the following:

    @code norg
    * I am a very long heading~
      which did not end here because of the trailing modifier
    @end

** Linkables
   Finally, there is one more kind of in-line syntax which are {# linkables}.

*** Link Location
    The locations where a link is pointing at are always placed inside of curly braces: `{}`.
    - | | TODO: add list of potential link targets.

*** Link Description
    Links can have custom descriptions which are always placed inside of square brackets: `[]`.

*** Links
    Links in _Norg_ can either be standalone a {# link location} in which case their text is used as
    the link title (as often makes sense for headings).

    When a custom description is required, it must be placed *_after_* the link location. This makes
    sense in terms of writing as you first define where you link to, and then describe it further.

*** Anchors
    _Norg_ also has a concept called {# anchors}. These allow you to place a standalone
    {# link description} inside of a text (referred to as an <anchor declaration>).
    The target which this anchor links to can then be _defined_ at another place in the document
    with an <anchor definition> which is an initial {# link description} followed by a
    {# link location}. This is especially useful when you want to link to the same target very
    often, like for example a specific website.

*** Inline Link Targets
    Finally, _Norg_ also has the possibility of placing link targets at arbitrary in-line positions
    in your document. We call this {# inline link targets} which are formatted inside of angle
    brackets: `<>`.
