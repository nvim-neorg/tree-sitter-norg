# NFF TreeSitter Parser 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvim-neorg/neorg/main/res/neorg.svg" width="70" height="70">

A TreeSitter grammar for [Neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg).

## Available Commands
| Command           | Result																				|
| -                 | -																						|
| `yarn`            | installs needed dependencies (only do if you don't have `tree-sitter` in your path)	|
| `yarn gen`		| `tree-sitter generate && node-gyp build`												|
| `yarn test`		| `tree-sitter test`																	|

- `npm` can be used instead of `yarn`
- When `yarn` is used with no args then it's replaced with `node install`

# Features
- Has support for pretty much the entire specification
- Isn't a massive editor hog

# Installation

For Linux and Windows, there is no extra configuration necessary.

> **Warning** <br />
> Installation on MacOS is going to break if you are using some other branch than main and also if your compiler is Apple GCC.

To fix that, Add the following lines to your Tree-Sitter config

```lua
local parser_configs = require('nvim-treesitter.parsers').get_parser_configs()

parser_configs.norg = {
  install_info = {
    url = 'https://github.com/vhyrro/tree-sitter-norg',
    files = {'src/parser.c', 'src/scanner.cc'},
    branch = 'main'
  }
}
```

and to change your compiler, 

```
brew install gcc
```

Now when you run `brew info gcc`
```
‚ùØ brew info gcc
...
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/gcc/12.2.0
...
```

This indicates that your GCC binary is in `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/gcc/12.2.0/bin/gcc-12`

Using that information, we override Apple's inbuilt cc with our new GCC installation.

```
sudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/Cellar/gcc/12.2.0/bin/gcc-12 /usr/local/bin/cc
```

Now if you install Norg Tree-Sitter parse through neovim, your errors will be fixed.
